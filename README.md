_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I am currently enrolled in Columbia Engineering Boot Camp to become a Full Stack Web Developer which has given me the foundation and tools to be both a Frontend and Backend Developer. 

The foundation, technical, and performance fundamentals I am developing while reinforcing newly developed skills and technologies include HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, JQuery, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, responsive web design and applications, agile methodology, computer science, database theory, MongoDB, and MySQL. 

⚡ Fun fact: I am a professional Chef
